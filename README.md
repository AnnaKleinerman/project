For this project, my goal was to conduct a thorough data analysis of a leasing company. I aimed to explore the following topics:

1. Do customers have any clear preferences for certain types of vehicles?
2. Do customers have any preferences for the year of manufacture of the vehicle?
3. Do customers have any preferences for the condition in which the vehicle is located?

# Based on my thorough analysis of the available data, I am confident in presenting the following conclusions:

# 1. There is a significant preference for automatic cars.
# 2. The car's model year or condition did not show any significant preference.
# 3. There are more automatic cars available for sale than manual or other types. Additionally, the most expensive car sold for an impressive $375,000 within just 21 days, and it was an automatic.
# 4. The price range for manual cars is between $700 and $65,000, with the most expensive manual car selling after 73 days.  

This app is designed to help you buy your dream car. You can filter the information in several categories such as price range, transmission type (automatic, manual, or other), and condition/model year. By using these filters, you can easily see the available vehicles and their quantity for sale.
